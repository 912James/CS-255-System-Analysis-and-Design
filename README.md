# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, wanted to create a system that would help drivers pass their driving tests using driver training. DriverPass would like us to support them in creating a website that will give the customer an opportunity to be prepared for their driving tests by providing access to online classes and practice tests as well as providing a reservations page where the client could make reservations for on the road driving lessons where they pick from one of three of the available packages.


What did you do particularly well?

I believe i showcased my understanding of all the different aspects of system design and did a great job detailing all the information given into what was required in the different UML diagrams. Every UML diagram provided a different way to present the requirements. I also think i did well presenting the timeline using the Gantt chart.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If i could change and revise one document to make improvements on, i would make changes on the DriverPass presentation powerpoint document. While i believe i did a good job on the presentation, with more time i could have made it look more professional. Towards the end of this class my kids came down with multiple sicknesses which took my attention away from performing to my best abilities with my schoolwork. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To create the necessary requirements for the system i took the clients interview transcript and created a business requirement document. Within the document i explained the purpose of the system design, the system background, the clients objectives and goals. From there i filled in the functional and nonfunctional requirements and finished it off by completing a Gantt chart displaying the timeline of every task for this project. The user's needs are the basis of the project and considering them is essential in being succesful when presenting them with a completed project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The approach i would take in designing software is to first under the users needs and requirements. From there we could start to breakdown the requiremnts into functonal and nonfucntional, where i could start to generalize the design. I would then create a simple interface for the required functionality which is clear and easy to use. Depending on the size of the project and the team we could use agile methodology to increase productivity and have flexibility throughout the project. To ensure we are meeting the customers needs we would create test cases to test the code and verify that they meet those requirements. From there i would scale the program to by adding all the feaures and functionilities the user requested as well as the various security elements we would be utilizing.
